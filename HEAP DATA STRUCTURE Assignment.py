Sol:
    Data structures are basically just that they are structures which can hold some data together. In
other words, they are used to store a collection of related data. There are four built-in data 
structures in Python-list, tuple, dictionary and set.Q. 2. Describe the Python user data structure?
Sol:Python supports many user-defined data structures i.e. the user can create their own data structures, like Stack, Queue, Tree, Linked List, Graph, and Hash Map.

Stack

Stacks are linear Data Structures which are based on the principle of Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) where data which is entered last will be the first to get accessed.

Queue

A queue is also a linear data structure which is based on the principle of First-In-First-Out (FIFO) where the data entered first will be accessed first.

Linked List

Linked lists are linear Data Structures which are not stored consequently but are linked with each other using pointers. The node of a linked list is composed of data and a pointer called next.

Tree

A tree is a non-linear data structure consisting of roots and nodes. The topmost base node is the root, and the elements present at the end of the tree are leaves. 

Graph

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. Nodes are known as vertices, and the lines connecting two nodes are generally called nodes.

HashMap

Hash Maps are indexed data structures and perform the same function as that performed by dictionary in Python. A hash map uses a hash function to compute index-key values into arrays. 

Q. 3. Describe the stages involved in writing an algorithm?
Sol : Algorithm is a step by step set of instructions designed to perform a specific task.

Steps involved in writing an algorithm are as below:

Obtain detailed information on the problem.
Analyze the problem.
Think of a problem solving approach.
Review the problem solving approach and try to think of a better Alternative.
Develop a basic structure of the Algorithm.
Optimize, Improvise and refine.
Review the algorithm.Q. 4. Outline the components of a good algorithm?

Sol: Below are the main components of a good algorithm
    
1. Unambiguous − Algorithm should be clear.
2. Input − An algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs.
3. Output − An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs, and should match the desired output.
4. Finiteness − Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps.
5. Well-Ordered - The exact order of operations performed in an algorithm should be concretely defined.
6. Independent - An algorithm should have step-by-step directions, which should be independent of any programming code.Q. 5. Describe the Tree traversal method?
Sol: Tree traversal involves traversing each node of the tree at least once where the information in the form of key and value can be retrieved for easy identification.


Q. 6. Explain the difference between inorder and postorder tree traversal?

Sol :INORDER TRAVERSAL -

An inorder traversal is a traversal technique that follows the policy, i.e., Left -> Root -> Right.

Here, the left subtree of the root node is traversed first, then the root node, and then the right subtree of the root node is traversed.

POSTORDER TRAVERSAL -

A Postorder traversal is a traversal technique that follows the policy, i.e., Left -> Right -> Root.

Here, the left subtree of the root node is traversed first, then the right-side sub-tree, and then finally the node is traversed.
