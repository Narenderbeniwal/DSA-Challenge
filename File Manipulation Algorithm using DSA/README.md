## How to use the File Manipulation Algorithm using DSA
1. Just give the location of the folder for which you want to manuipulate the file. Algorithm will automatically detect the file extenstion and create the folder for that. For Ex: for .png file it will create the image folder and for the .ipynb file it will create the python folder. 
2. Also if yyou want to add the more file extenstion you can update the code and add the files. And the files will be in the sorted order in the folders
