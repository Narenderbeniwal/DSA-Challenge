# DSA-Challenge: 1

 Security and privacy issues of the transmitted data have become an important concern in multimedia technology So i have desgined an Encrytption/Decryption algorithm to protect the videos, so that the algorithm can digitally hide your videos to avoid unauthorised interception and viewing. To safeguard the material, videos are encrypted with an encoding method. Without the proper authorization, no one can watch the encrypted videos.
 
 # Encryption/Decryption
 
 The process of converting plaintext to ciphertext is called enciphering or encryption; restoring plaintext from ciphertext is deciphering or decryption. Both the encryption and decryption algorithms take a key (K) and plaintext/ciphertext as input. In the case of images, plaintext is a set of pixel values arranged in an orderly manner. Encrypting images/videos constitutes reordering these pixel values so that they convey no visual information about the original image. An image/video can also be encrypted in the compressed domain. In this case, the DCT coefficients are encrypted in such a way that the content is made illegible for the unauthorized. Only an authorized user can get back the original content using the decryption algorithm

# Follow the below steps to run the Video Ciphering Algorithm
## 1. Run the command: python main.py runserver

## 2. Then Type 'EN' for 'Encryption'
## 3. After that give the path of the video that you want to Encrypt

## 4. Enter the name of file you want to Encrypt
## 5.Enter the extension : ( For eg :- .mp4, .csv, .txt, .png etc ) 
## 6. Confirm to Encryption
## 7. Enter the name of new File
## 8. Then you file will be Encrypted
